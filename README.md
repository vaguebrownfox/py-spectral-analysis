# Python signal processing

## Spectral analysis

Plotting spectrum of stationary signal recorded by different devices

-   Take one sound at a time (e.g. Sustained phonation, White noise)
-   20 ms chunks of audio
-   Compute spectrum at each chunk
-   Take mean of all spectrum and plot
-   Plot for all recording of same sound from different devices on the same graph
-   Generate graph for all different sounds put it in folder
